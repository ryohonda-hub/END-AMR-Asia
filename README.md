# END-AMR-Asia
## Asia-Pacific Researcher Network on Environmental Dimension of Antimicrobial Resistance (END-AMR-Asia)
The mission of END-AMR-Asia is to provide academic knowledge and opinions to mitigate AMR burdens in environment from Asian context, which includes their vulnerability, limited resource settings and infrastructure, cultural and social behaviors, etc. 

### Scripts for metagenomic ARG profiling in environment samples
Scripts for profiling of antimicrobial resistome from metagenomic sequences are published here. The scripts used in our publications are available in the [pub](https://github.com/ryohonda-hub/END-AMR-Asia/tree/main/pub) directory. The latest scripts are available in the [latest](https://github.com/ryohonda-hub/END-AMR-Asia/tree/main/latest) directory. 

All shell scripts are coded to work on the [NIG supercomputer](https://sc.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/en/) but would work also on your system with slight modifications. The python scripts would work on most systems.
