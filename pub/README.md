# Script Repository for Published Works
Scripts used in our publications are available here.
Shell scripts are coded to work on the [NIG supercomputer](https://sc.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/en/). To use them on your system, delete the lines starting with "singularity" and unnecessary header lines from the script.
